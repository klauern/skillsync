# Testing

## Running Tests
```bash
make test             # Run all tests with coverage
make test-coverage    # View coverage report in browser
```

## Conventions
- Write tests alongside code: `foo_test.go` in same package
- Use table-driven tests for multiple cases
- Race detector enabled by default (Makefile:24)
- Target >80% coverage for new code

## Test Helpers
- See internal/util/testhelpers.go:1 for shared utilities
